# Amazon_Filter

(Only works a few days before Christmas)

1. Search for an item on Amazon
2. Paste this code in the browser console
3. You can now hit the "D" key to delete any items that don't deliver before Christmas

---

Inspired by the fact that Amazon doesn't let you filter out these items for some reason.
